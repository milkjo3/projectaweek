# project-a-week-or-maybe-a-month
Welcome to my Project Challenge! The goal of this repository is to create a new project occasionally and share the journey, ideas, and code with the community. Each project will be different, showcasing new skills, tools, and frameworks while tackling various interesting problems.

Challenge Objective
The idea is simple:

Create one unique project every now and time.
Each project will showcase a specific theme or technology, allowing me to explore a wide range of topics, including web development, machine learning, data science, automation, and more.
By the end of the year (or however long this challenge lasts), there will be 52 projects to showcase the growth in skills, creativity, and problem-solving.
## Projects List
Here, I’ll maintain a list of each week's project along with a brief description of the goals, technologies used, and challenges faced.

| Project | Project Name       | Description                                                     | Technologies Used   |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | [Project 1: Pokemon YOLOv8 Detection Model](./week1-project-name) | Creating a YOLOv8 realtime computer vision model to detect Pokemon in Images. | Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, PyTorch |
| ...  | ...                | ...                                                             | ...                 |
| 52   | [Final Project TBD](./week52-project-name) | TBD | TBD |

Note: Each project, I will link to the respective project folder, so you can follow the development process, check the code, or try out the project yourself.

### How the Challenge Works
1. Start with an Idea
Each time period, I will choose a new project idea to work on. The project could range from building a simple tool, solving an algorithmic problem, to creating full-fledged applications. The goal is to learn something new and share the experience.

2. Planning the Project
Before diving into coding, I’ll define:
~~~
The core objective of the project.
The technologies and tools I’ll use.
The timeline for development.
Any milestones or important checkpoints for each week.
~~~
3. Develop the Project
I'll spend the time period coding and experimenting with the chosen technology. Each project will be kept simple yet meaningful, focusing on practicality and learning rather than perfection.

4. Document the Process
I'll write documentation (like this README) and comment on the code so that others can follow along or learn from the projects.

5. Deploy and Share
I’ll try to deploy the project (if applicable) and share it for public use. Whether it's a web app, a script, or an AI model, I will make it available so others can test, use, and provide feedback.

### Project Structure
Each project is stored in its own directory under the weekX-project-name folder. Inside each project folder, you'll find:
~~~
README.md: Project details, how to use it, and any other important info.
source_code/: The source code for the project (could be a single file or multiple).
assets/: Any images, data files, or other assets needed for the project.
requirements.txt: A list of dependencies (if applicable).
Technologies & Tools: The challenge covers a wide array of technologies. Each project will lay out what tools and technologies used. 
~~~
### How You Can Get Involved
I’d love for others to join me in this challenge or contribute ideas! Here’s how you can get involved:

**Fork this repo**: Create your own version of the challenge, and track your own projects.

**Contribute Ideas**: If you have a fun project idea, let me know, and I'll try to implement it in the future weeks.

**Collaborate**: If you have a specific skill set (e.g., web design, data science), feel free to collaborate on one of the projects!

**Feedback**: Feel free to leave comments or open issues if you have suggestions, improvements, or even corrections.
